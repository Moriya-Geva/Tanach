# Tanach Search - C# Bible Text Search Application

## Project Overview
This project is a C# application designed to search and retrieve verses from the Tanach (Hebrew Bible) text. The project is structured using a layered architecture with Data Access Layer (DAL), Business Logic Layer (BLL), Data Transfer Objects (DTO), and Presentation Layer (PL). The BLL handles complex search logic including partial word matching and text normalization, while the DAL provides the raw Torah text data. The application supports searching by words, full words, multiple words, and variants with missing letters.

## Key Components
DAL (Data Access Layer): Reads the full Torah text from a file and provides it to the business logic.

BLL (Business Logic Layer): Contains core search functions that parse the Torah text and return verses matching search queries. It supports advanced searches including partial matches and variations of words with missing letters like ו and י.

DTO (Data Transfer Objects): Defines data structures such as AllTora representing verses and Json for caching previous search results.

PL (Presentation Layer): The UI application entry point, which runs a Windows Forms interface (Form2) for user interaction.

## Technologies Used
**Programming Language:** C# (.NET Framework / .NET Core)

**Framework:** Windows Forms for UI

**Libraries:**

Newtonsoft.Json for JSON serialization and deserialization

**Tools:** Visual Studio or any C# compatible IDE

## Setup and Running
Ensure you have .NET installed and Visual Studio or other C# IDE.

Clone the repository and open the solution/project file.

Place the Torah text file (tora.txt) and the initial history.json in the project directory.

Build and run the project. The Windows Forms UI will launch.

## Usage
Enter a word or phrase to search in the Torah text.

The application will return a list of verses containing the search string, including advanced variants with missing letters.

Results include the book (Chumash), chapter (Perek), verse (Pasuk), and the verse text (Melel).

Previous searches and their variants are cached in history.json for faster subsequent lookups.

## Notes
The search supports partial and full word matching.

Word variants are generated by removing certain Hebrew letters (ו, י) to account for spelling differences.

The architecture allows future extensions, such as adding difficulty levels, phrase search, or UI enhancements.
